## General Info
This human following will be having a ultrasonic sensor which will work as a medium of tracking the object that comes in front of it. We will be coding the arduino nano in this way that when a object comes near ultrasonic sensor and if its distance is less than 5cm then it will go backward and if it is more than 10 cm and less than 20 cm, than it will go forward and more than 20 cm and less than 25 cm, than it will go left etc.
